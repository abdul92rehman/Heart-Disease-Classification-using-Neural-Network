# Heart-Disease-Classification-using-Neural-Network
The main Objective of this Study is to develop a model that can classify that whether a patient is suffering from Heart disease based on the existing attributes like age, 
cholesterol, diabetes, hyper pressure.

Artificial Neural Network is used to classify the disease. you can fine the data and variable's detail in (Heart-Disease-Classification-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm) Repository
